# Roblox Portfolio Redirect
### AKA: "Why did I make a repository with one line of HTML" 

### Why do this?
I had a friend encounter an issue where they had their portfolio on the talent hub suspended due to their portfolio website not being an allowed URL. This is a (hopefully) temporary and somewhat easy workaround for now.

**I am not responsible for any suspensions or terminations through the usage of this repository to redirect to external sites. By using this method, you acknowledge that using this method may risk your account. Hopefully Roblox makes this not an issue in the future but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**

**Also I am aware this is opening up a pandora's box of potentially malicious sites through Roblox creator page, please click responsibly and use [tools like redirect-checker.org](https://www.redirect-checker.org/) if you wanna be more sure.**

### Usage:
1. Fork the repo
2. Change the repository name to \<your GitHub username>.github.io
    - For example, my username **on GitHub** is `raymondwzeng`, thus the repository name is `raymondwzeng.github.io`
3. Change the domain in `index.html` to your domain
    - Make sure you don't accidentally delete the single quote - that'll break things.
4. Profit. Put it on your portfolio with the GitHub link, and it should automatically redirect anyone to your actual portfolio.
